When the batch pods are scaled down, TSA.STATUS and TSA.RUNNING.SERVICE are not cleared in Cloud 2.0.
In the case of autoscale, we have a cleanup API to clear off the residual TSA.STATUS/T24.SESSION. This API is triggered during the scale-down of the batch pod. 

1) Add the cleanup.sh script in the preimage.tar of the autoscale pod preimage under the path /srv/Temenos/TAFJ/bin.
  

 2) Include the below section in the autoscale pod deployment yaml file.
